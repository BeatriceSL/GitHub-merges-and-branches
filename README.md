1. Tic Tac Toe Game

How It Works:
1. The game board is represented as a list of 9 elements, where each element corresponds to a cell in the Tic Tac Toe grid.
2. The player is represented by the kitty (😺), and the computer is represented by Pikachu (🐭).
3. The player inputs their move by entering a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the grid positions.
4. The computer makes a random move from the available positions.
5. The game checks for a winner after each move and declares the result if there’s a win or a tie.
